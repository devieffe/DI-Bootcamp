West apologises to Jewish community for 2022 antisemitic remarks

Rapper posts message in Hebrew to social media, saying he is committed to making amends and 
promoting unity

Kanye West has apologised to “the Jewish community” for a series of antisemitic remarks he made in 2022.

In a statement posted in Hebrew on his Instagram account, where he has 18.2m followers, 
he wrote (as translated by Google): “I sincerely apologise to the Jewish community … 
It was not my intention to hurt or demean, and I deeply regret any pain I may have caused. 
I am committed to starting with myself and learning from this experience to ensure greater sensitivity 
and understanding in the future. Your forgiveness is important to me, and I am committed to making 
amends and promoting unity.”

West, also known as Ye, was widely condemned after writing on X in October 2022 that he was 
“going death con 3 On JEWISH PEOPLE … You guys have toyed with me and tried to black ball anyone 
whoever opposes your agenda.” He posted a screenshot of a conversation with the rapper Diddy, 
in which West wrote: “Ima use you as an example to show the Jewish people that told you to call 
me that no one can threaten or influence me.”

The comments prompted Adidas to cut ties with West and end its lucrative Yeezy footwear partnership, 
with the company calling his comments “unacceptable, hateful and dangerous”. (Adidas’s chief executive 
Bjørn Gulden later said: “I don’t think he meant what he said and I don’t think he’s a bad person – 
it just came across that way.”) Gap, which also partnered with West and was already winding up their 
collaboration, stopped stocking West-affiliated products.
