// Daily Planner Application Using React-Redux
// Create a daily planner application allowing users to manage tasks for specific days. The application should allow users to view tasks for different days, add new tasks, edit existing tasks, and delete tasks.
// Step 1: Set Up Redux Store
// Initialize Store:
// Use Redux Toolkit’s configureStore to set up the Redux store.
// Define initial state with an object that holds tasks for different days.
// Set up the necessary reducers and actions to handle task management for each day.
// Step 2: Actions And Reducers
// Task Actions:
// Create actions for:
// Adding a task for a specific day (addTask).
// Editing an existing task for a specific day (editTask).
// Deleting a task for a specific day (deleteTask).
// Reducers:
// Implement reducers to handle each action for managing tasks for different days.
// Update the Redux store state based on the dispatched actions.
// Step 3: Calendar/Date Picker Component
// Calendar Component:
// Develop a component to display a calendar or date picker.
// Implement functionality to select different days and trigger actions based on the selected day.
// Step 4: Task Display And Management Components
// TaskList Component:
// Create a component to display tasks for the selected day.
// Use useSelector to access tasks for the selected day from the Redux store.
// AddTask Component:
// Implement a component to add new tasks for the selected day.
// Utilize useDispatch to dispatch the addTask action to the Redux store.
// EditTask Component:
// Build a component to edit existing tasks for the selected day.
// Dispatch the editTask action to update the task in the Redux store.
// DeleteTask Component:
// Create a component to delete tasks for the selected day.
// Dispatch the deleteTask action to remove the task from the Redux store.
// Step 5: Connect Components To Redux Store
// Use useSelector and useDispatch:
// Within each component, use useSelector to access tasks for the selected day from the Redux store.
// Dispatch actions using useDispatch to interact with the store for adding, editing, or deleting tasks.
// Step 6: Update Display According To Selected Day
// Task Display Update:
// Ensure that the TaskList component updates and displays tasks according to the selected day from the calendar/date picker.
// Verify that adding, editing, or deleting tasks correctly updates the task list for the selected day.
// By following these steps, you’ll create a Daily Planner application using React-Redux, allowing users to manage tasks for specific days effectively. The application will facilitate viewing, adding, editing, and deleting tasks, seamlessly interacting with the Redux store for state management.
